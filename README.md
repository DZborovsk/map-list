Geolocation is an indispensable weapon of the good iOS developer kit, it is essential to
know how to use it.
Apple makes available to you different frameworks like MapKit which allows you to
use a very simple map or CoreLocation which allows you to manage the userâ€™s location.
These 2 frameworks will be your best friends for this day.

You will create a geolocation application of several places using:

a TabBarController : to organise your different views.
a MKMapView : for the map.
a CLLocationManager : to geolocate the user.
a SegmentedControlBar : to change the style of the map.
a MKAnnotationView : to customize the pop-up map.
